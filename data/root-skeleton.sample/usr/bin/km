Usage:
  km <keymap>
  km -l

"km" is a wrapper for Busybox' "loadkmap" applet that allows
you to load a keymap different from the US standard keyboard
which Busybox loads by default. However, depending on how
(un)familiar you are with the US keyboard, typing

  $ cat /usr/share/keymaps/i386/de-latin1.bmap | loadkmap

may be a little hard. Instead, you can just use km:

  $ km de-latin1

This way you can just feed "km" with the basename of the keymap
file and you're done. To get a list of all available keymaps,
use

  $ km -l

. See the table at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/KEYMAP for
finding out which keymap belongs to your country's usual keyboards.
Note by default only keymaps from the i386 set are included; if you
need other ones, compile them with "loadkeys -b <file>" on your main
box and copy them into the initramfs at the /usr/share/keymaps/ folder.
