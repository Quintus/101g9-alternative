How to assemble your alternative OS
===================================

1. Cross-compile Busybox with the configuration in `data/configs` and
   install it somewhere you find it.
     $ cd <BUSYBOXDOWNLOADPATH>
     $ cp <INSTALLPATH>/data/configs/busybox*.config .config
     $ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi-
     $ make install
   NOTE: Busybox will be installed to `$PWD/_install` by default.
2. Cross-compile Linux with the configuration which yet has to be
   found...
3. Execute the Initramfs generator:
     # ruby bin/makeinitramfs -d data/device_table.txt -i data/init \
     -s data/root-skeleton -b <BUSYBOXDOWNLOADPATH>/_install
4. You have the ready initramfs.cpio.lzo in your current working
   directory. Flash this and the kernel on the tablet, and youâ€™re
   done.
